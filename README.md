# windows-image-collector
Run this batch script in your photo location. (Sorry Windows only). The script symbolically links all your photos and sub directory photos into one location called C:\pics. So why would you want this because windows background and/or screensaver doesnâ€™t allow sub folders. So after running this script go to windows background and/or screensaver and use the pics directory.

# Install
Download, "collector.bat" to your image location and run it.

# Optional
change jpg to png or whatever you would like to use.
